# Philip's Automated Arch Install
You shouldn't use this, you should follow the Arch installation wiki / build your own scripts.

This is just how I bootstrap my own installation, and is scripted so that I can blow away my machines and reformat them willy-nilly.

There's nothing particular suprising here, it's largely just scripting the steps from the Arch wiki at the point where I did my first installation, tailoured for use with LUKS + LVM and systemd-boot on a UEFI system.
